One orange octopus occupies our opalescent ocean.
Two toucans tentatively traverse taut tightropes.
Three thrushes twitter together towards twilight.
Four festive fireflies flicker for fun.
Five flickers flit forwards.
Six sensitive seals slip silently southward.
Seven songbirds sing sonorously.
Eight elegant elephants empathically elucidate endnotes.
Nine nomcommittal narwals noiselessly nosh.
